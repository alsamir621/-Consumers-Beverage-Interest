# -Consumers-Beverage-Interest

As a part of my learning journey, I'm excited to share my recent project on Bangladesh's consumers' recent beverage interests in the market in 2024.

With the help of my company, InsightForge Solutions my team collected real-time data through surveys. After analyzing the whole data set, I found out that 'Mojo', which is an AKIJ FOOD & BEVARAGE LIMITED (AFBL) product, is currently dominating the beverage market of Bangladesh, capturing 23.5% of the market alone, and on the other hand, Drinko, which is a Pran Food product, is also dominating the market by capturing 12.5% of it. Surprisingly, both Bangladeshi products alone surpassed the MNC giant PepsiCo's products, and that's astonishing! 

However, we also found out that the majority age of beverage consumers is 20–30, capturing 50% of the market alone. Ages 10–20 were the second highest, capturing 33%. The male consumers were 57.8%, and the female consumers were 42.2%.

A large portion of consumers gave their opinion that they mainly get attracted to a beverage item only because of the taste (45%), and also when they find it cheap (22%), and healthy (10%). 

Expectations of the consumers for upcoming drinks:
1. They want it healthy but also want to feel the carbonated flavor.
2. It should help to lose weight.
3. Current electrolyte drinks don't taste that much, that's why the consumers demanded something new. (And personally, I also think it's high time for our beverage industries to move towards new tastes of electrolytes and something unique.)
4. Drinks that are sugar-free and always help to stay hydrated.
